        <p>Silo is the pseudonym of Mario Luis Rodr√≠guez Cobos.</p>

        <p>He was born in 1938 near Mendoza, located between Argentina and Chile.</p>

        <p>He died on 16 september 2010.</p>

        <br/>

        <p>He is considered the founder of the New Humanism, which attitude can be summarized:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Placing the human being as the central value and concern, in such a way that nothing is above the human being and no human being is above
                another.
            </li>
            <li>Affirming the equality of all human beings.</li>
            <li>Recognizing personal and cultural diversity, affirming the characteristics proper to each human group and condemning discrimination, whether
                motivated by economic, racial, ethnic, or cultural differences.
            </li>
            <li>Developing knowledge beyond the limitations imposed by prejudices accepted as absolute and immutable truths.</li>
            <li>Affirming the freedom of ideas and beliefs.</li>
            <li>Repudiating violence in all its forms.</li>
        </ul>
