<p><em>note from the printers</em></p>

<p>The Message given by Silo in July of 2002 consists of three parts: The
Book, The Experience, and the Path.<br/>
The Book has been known for some time under the title <em>The Inner Look.</em><br/>
The Experience is approached through eight ceremonies.<br/>
The Path is a collection of reflections and suggestions.<br/>
This edition contains the Message in its entirety. It circulates in both
printed and electronic form.</p>

<h1 id="thebook">The Book</h1>

<h2 id="i.meditation">I. Meditation</h2>

<p>​1. Here it tells how the non-meaning of life can be converted into
meaning and fulfillment.</p>

<p>​2. Here are joy, love of the body, of nature, of humanity, and of the
spirit.</p>

<p>​3. Here sacrifices, feelings of guilt, and threats from the beyond are
rejected.</p>

<p>​4. Here the worldly is not opposed to the eternal.</p>

<p>​5. Here it tells of the inner revelation at which all arrive who
carefully meditate in humble search.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="ii.dispositiontocomprehend">II. Disposition to Comprehend</h2>

<p>​1. I know how you feel because I can experience your state, but you do
not know how to experience the things I am speaking of. Therefore, if I
speak to you without self-interest of that which makes the human being
happy and free, it is worth your while to try to comprehend.</p>

<p>​2. Do not think that you will arrive at understanding by arguing with
me. You may do so if you believe that in this way your understanding
will become clearer, but it is not the appropriate path in this case. </p>

<p>​3. If you ask me what attitude is appropriate, I will tell you that it
is to meditate profoundly and without haste on what is explained here.</p>

<p>​4. If you reply that you are busy with more urgent things, I will
answer that since your wish is to sleep or to die, I will do nothing to
oppose it. </p>

<p>​5. Nor should you argue that you dislike my way of presenting things,
for you do not criticize the peel when you like the fruit. </p>

<p>​6. I state things in the way I consider appropriate, not as might be
desired by those who aspire to things remote from inner truth.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="iii.non-meaning">III. Non-Meaning</h2>

<p><em>Over many days I discovered this great paradox: Those who bore failure
in their hearts were able to illuminate the final victory, while those
who felt triumphant were left by the wayside, vegetating in their muted
and diffuse life. Over many days, coming from the darkest of darkness, I
arrived at the light, guided not by teachings but by meditation.</em></p>

<p><em>Thus, I told myself on the first day:</em></p>

<p>​1. There is no meaning in life if everything ends with death.</p>

<p>​2. All justification for actions, whether these actions are despicable
or admirable, is always a new dream that leaves only emptiness ahead.</p>

<p>​3. God is something uncertain.</p>

<p>​4. Faith is something as variable as reason and dreams.</p>

<p>​5. “What one should do” may be thoroughly discussed, but in the end
there is nothing that definitively supports any position.</p>

<p>​6. The “responsibility” of those who commit themselves to something is
no greater than the responsibility of those who do not.</p>

<p>​7. I move according to my interests, and this makes me neither a coward
nor a hero.</p>

<p>​8. “My interests” neither justify nor discredit anything.</p>

<p>​9. “My reasons” are no better than the reasons of others, nor are they
worse.</p>

<p>​10. Cruelty horrifies me, but neither because of this nor in itself is
it better or worse than kindness.</p>

<p>​11. What I or others say today is of no value tomorrow.</p>

<p>​12. To die is not better than to live or never to have been born, but
neither is it worse.</p>

<p>​13. I discovered, not through teachings, but through experience and
meditation, that there is no meaning in life if everything ends with
death.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="iv.dependence">IV. Dependence</h2>

<p><em>The second day.</em></p>

<p>​1. Nothing that I do, feel, or think depends on me.</p>

<p>​2. I am mutable and depend on the action of my surroundings. When I
want to change my environment or my “I,” it is the environment that ends
up changing me. Then I seek the city or nature, social redemption or a
new struggle that will justify my existence. In every case it is my
environment that leads me to choose one attitude or another. In this
way, my interests and my surroundings leave me here.</p>

<p>​3. I say, then, that it does not matter who or what decides. I say on
these occasions that I have to live since I am in the situation of
living. I say all this, but there is nothing that justifies it. I can
make a decision, hesitate, or remain where I am. In any case, one thing
is only provisionally better than another; ultimately there is no better
or worse.</p>

<p>​4. If someone tells me that those who do not eat die, I will answer
that this is indeed so, and that, spurred by their needs, they are
compelled to eat. But I will not add that the struggle to eat justifies
one’s existence—nor will I say that this struggle is bad. I will simply
say that all of this concerns an individual or collective fact related
to the need for subsistence, but that it has no meaning in the moment
that the last battle is lost.</p>

<p>​5. I will say, moreover, that I feel solidarity with the struggle of
the poor, the exploited, and the persecuted. I will say that I feel
“fulfilled” in this identification, but I understand that these feelings
do not justify anything. </p>

<hr />

<h2 id="v.intimationofmeaning">V. Intimation of Meaning</h2>

<p><em>The third day.</em></p>

<p>​1. At times I have anticipated events that later took place.</p>

<p>​2. At times I have grasped a distant thought.</p>

<p>​3. At times I have described places I have never been.</p>

<p>​4. At times I have recounted exactly what took place in my absence. </p>

<p>​5. At times an immense joy has surprised me.</p>

<p>​6. At times a total comprehension has overwhelmed me. </p>

<p>​7. At times a perfect communion with everything has filled me with
ecstasy. </p>

<p>​8. At times I have broken through my reveries and seen reality in a new
way.</p>

<p>​9. At times I have seen something for the first time, yet recognized it
as though I had seen it before.</p>

<p>**…And all this has made me think. It is clear to me that without these
experiences I could not have emerged from the non-meaning.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="vi.sleepandawakening">VI. Sleep and Awakening</h2>

<p><em>The fourth day.</em></p>

<p>​1. I cannot take as real what I see in my dreams, nor what I see in
semi-sleep, nor what I see when I am awake but in reverie.<em> </em></p>

<p>​2. I can take as real what I see when I am awake and without reveries.
Here I am not speaking of what my senses register, since naive and
dubious “data” can arrive from my external and internal senses as well
as from my memory. Rather, I am speaking of the activities of my mind as
they relate to the “data” being thought. What is valid is that when my
mind is awake it “knows” and when it is asleep it “believes.” Only
rarely do I perceive reality in a new way, and it is then that I realize
that what I normally see resembles sleep or semi-sleep.</p>

<p><em>There is a real way of being awake, and it has led me to meditate
profoundly on all that has been said so far. It has, moreover, opened
the door for me to discover the meaning of all that exists.</em></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="vii.presenceoftheforce">VII. Presence of the Force</h2>

<p><em>The fifth day.</em></p>

<p>​1. When I was truly awake I scaled from comprehension to comprehension.</p>

<p>​2. When I was truly awake yet lacked the strength to continue the
ascent, I was able to draw the Force from within myself. This Force was
present throughout my body. All of the energy was present even in the
smallest cells of my body, and it circulated more rapidly and more
intensely than my blood.</p>

<p>​3. I discovered that the energy concentrated in those points of my body
that were active, and was absent when they were not. </p>

<p>​4. During illness the energy was either lacking or it accumulated
precisely in the areas of my body that were affected. But if I was able
to reestablish the normal flow of the energy, many illnesses began to
recede.</p>

<p><em>Some peoples knew this, and through various procedures that seem
strange to us today they were able to reestablish the flow of the
energy.</em></p>

<p><em>Some peoples knew this, and they were able to communicate this energy
to others, producing “illuminations” of comprehension and even physical
“miracles.”</em></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="viii.controloftheforce">VIII. Control of the Force</h2>

<p><em>The sixth day.</em></p>

<p>​1. There is a way of directing and concentrating the Force that
circulates through the body.</p>

<p>​2. In the body are points of control on which depend what we know as
movement, emotion, and idea. When the energy acts in these points it
gives rise to motor, emotional, and intellectual manifestations.</p>

<p>​3. Depending on whether the energy acts more internally or
superficially in the body, the states of deep sleep, semi-sleep, or
wakefulness arise. Surely, the halos that surround the bodies or heads
of the saints (or the great awakened ones) in religious paintings allude
to this phenomenon of the energy, which on occasion manifests more
externally.</p>

<p>​4. There is a point of control of being-truly-awake, and there is a way
of bringing the Force to this point.</p>

<p>​5. When the energy is led to this point, all the other points of
control move in a new way.</p>

<p><em>Upon understanding this and hurling the Force to this superior point,
my entire body felt the impact of an enormous energy. This energy struck
powerfully within my consciousness, and I ascended from comprehension to
comprehension. But I also observed that if I lost control of the energy
I could descend to the depths of the mind. Then, seeing the dividing
line between these mental states, I remembered the legends of “heavens”
and “hells.”</em></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="ix.manifestationsoftheenergy">IX. Manifestations of the Energy</h2>

<p><em>The seventh day.</em></p>

<p>​1. This energy in motion could become “independent” of the body yet
still maintain its unity.</p>

<p>​2. This unified energy was really a sort of “double” of the body,
corresponding to the coenesthetic representation of one’s own body
within the space of representation. The sciences that deal with mental
phenomena have not paid sufficient attention to the existence of this
space or to the representations that correspond to the internal
sensations of the body.</p>

<p>​3. The energy duplicated in this way, that is imagined as if “outside”
the body or “separated” from its material base, either dissolved as an
image or was represented correctly, depending on the internal unity of
the one carrying out this work.</p>

<p>​4. I was able to confirm that the “exteriorization” of this energy,
which represented one’s body as “outside” of one’s body, could be
produced even from the lowest levels of the mind. In these cases, a
threat to the most basic unity of the living being provoked this
response in order to safeguard the one who was in danger. That is why,
in the trances of some mediums whose level of consciousness was low and
whose internal unity was imperiled, these responses occurred
involuntarily and were not recognized as being self-produced, but were
attributed to other entities.</p>

<p><em>The “ghosts” of certain peoples, like the “spirits” of some
fortunetellers, were nothing but the “doubles” (the
self-representations) of those who felt themselves possessed. Having
lost control of the Force, their mental state was darkened in trance,
and they felt controlled by strange beings that at times produced
remarkable phenomena. Doubtless this was the case of many who were said
to be “possessed.” What was decisive, then, was control of the Force.</em></p>

<p><em>All this changed completely my conception of both daily life and of
life after death. Through these thoughts and experiences I began to lose
faith in death, and now I no longer believe in it, just as I no longer
believe in the non-meaning of life.</em></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="x.evidenceofmeaning">X. Evidence of Meaning</h2>

<p><em>The eighth day.</em></p>

<p>​1. The real importance of an awakened life became evident to me. </p>

<p>​2. The real importance of eliminating internal contradictions convinced
me.</p>

<p>​3. The real importance of mastering the Force in order to achieve unity
and continuity filled me with joyful meaning.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="xi.theluminouscenter">XI. The Luminous Center</h2>

<p><em>The ninth day.</em></p>

<p>​1. In the Force was “the light” that came from a “center.”</p>

<p>​2. In withdrawal from the center there was a dissolution of the energy,
while in the unification and evolution of the energy that luminous
center was at work.</p>

<p><em>It did not strike me as strange to find a devotion to the Sun-god among
ancient peoples. And I understood that while some worshipped this
heavenly object because it gave life to the earth and to nature, others
recognized in that majestic body the symbol of a greater reality.</em></p>

<p><em>There were those who went still further and received innumerable gifts
from this center, gifts that at times “descended” as tongues of fire
over the inspired ones, at times arrived as luminous spheres, and at
times appeared as burning bushes before the fearful believer.</em></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="xii.thediscoveries">XII. The Discoveries</h2>

<p><em>The tenth day.</em></p>

<p><em>Few but important were my discoveries, which I summarize this way:</em></p>

<p>​1. Though the Force circulates through the body involuntarily, it can
be directed through conscious effort. Achieving an intentional change in
the level of consciousness grants the human being an important glimpse
of liberation from the “natural” conditions that seem to impose
themselves on the consciousness.</p>

<p>​2. Within the body are points that control its diverse activities.</p>

<p>​3. There are differences between the state of being-truly-awake and
other levels of consciousness.</p>

<p>​4. The Force can be led to the point of real awakening (understanding
by “Force” the mental energy that accompanies particular images and by
“point” the location of such an image in a certain “place” in the space
of representation).</p>

<p><em>These conclusions led me to recognize in the prayers of ancient peoples
the seed of a great truth—a truth later obscured by external rites and
practices,</em> <em>making it impossible for them to develop that internal work
which, realized with perfection, puts human beings in contact with their
luminous source. Finally, I observed that my “discoveries” were not
discoveries at all, but arose from the inner revelation at which all
arrive who, without contradictions, search for the light in their own
hearts.</em></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="xiii.theprinciples">XIII. The Principles</h2>

<p><em>Different is the attitude toward life and things when inner revelation
strikes like lightning.</em></p>

<p><em>Following the steps slowly, meditating on what has been said and what
has yet to be said, you may convert the non-meaning into meaning. It is
not indifferent what you do with your life. Your life, subject to laws,
is open to possibilities among which you can choose. I do not speak to
you of liberty. I speak to you of liberation, of movement, of process. I
do not speak to you of liberty as something static, but of liberating
yourself step-by-step, as those who approach their city become liberated
from the road already traveled. Thus, “what one must do” depends not
upon distant, incomprehensible, and conventional morals, but upon laws:
laws of life, of light, of evolution.</em></p>

<p><em>Here are the “Principles” which can help you in your search for
internal unity:</em></p>

<p>​1. To go against the evolution of things is to go against yourself.</p>

<p>​2. When you force something toward an end, you produce the contrary.</p>

<p>​3. Do not oppose a great force. Retreat until it weakens, then advance
with resolution.</p>

<p>​4. Things are well when they move together, not in isolation.</p>

<p>​5. If day and night, summer and winter are well with you, you have
surpassed the contradictions.</p>

<p>​6. If you pursue pleasure, you enchain yourself to suffering. But as
long as you do not harm your health, enjoy without inhibition when the
opportunity presents itself.</p>

<p>​7. If you pursue an end, you enchain yourself. If everything you do is
realized as though it were an end in itself, you liberate yourself.</p>

<p>​8. You will make your conflicts disappear when you understand them in
their ultimate root, not when you want to resolve them.</p>

<p>​9. When you harm others you remain enchained, but if you do not harm
anyone you can freely do whatever you want.</p>

<p>​10. When you treat others as you want them to treat you, you liberate
yourself.</p>

<p>​11. It does not matter in which faction events have placed you. What
matters is that you comprehend that you have not chosen any faction.</p>

<p>​12. Contradictory or unifying actions accumulate within you. If you
repeat your acts of internal unity, nothing can detain you.</p>

<p><em>You will be like a force of Nature when it finds no resistance in its
path. Learn to distinguish a difficulty, a problem, an obstacle, from a
contradiction. While those may move you or spur you on, contradiction
traps you in a closed circle with no way out.</em></p>

<p><em>Whenever you find great strength, joy, and kindness in your heart, or
when you feel free and without contradictions, immediately be internally
thankful. When you find yourself in opposite circumstances, ask with
faith, and the gratitude you have accumulated will return to you
transformed and amplified in benefit.</em></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="xiv.guidetotheinnerroad">XIV. Guide to the Inner Road</h2>

<p><em>If you understand what I have explained so far, you can, through a
simple exercise, readily experience the manifestation of the Force. It
is not the same, however, to search for the correct mental position (as
if this were a question of approaching a technical task) as it is to
enter the kind of emotional tone and openness that poetry inspires. The
language used to transmit these truths, then, is intended to facilitate
an attitude that makes it easier to be in the presence of internal
perception, rather than in the presence of an idea of “internal
perception.”</em></p>

<p><em>Now follow attentively what I will explain to you, because it concerns
the inner landscape you may encounter when working with the Force, and
the directions you can imprint on your mental movements.</em></p>

<p><em>“On the inner road you may walk darkened or luminous. Attend to the two
roads that open before you.</em></p>

<p><em>If you let your being cast itself toward dark regions, your body wins
the battle and it dominates. Then, sensations and appearances of
spirits, of forces, of memories will arise. On this road you descend
further and further. Here dwell Hatred, Vengeance, Strangeness,
Possession, Jealousy, and the Desire to Remain. Should you descend even
further you will be invaded by Frustration, Resentment, and all those
dreams and desires that have brought ruin and death upon humanity.</em></p>

<p><em>If you impel your being in a luminous direction, you will find
resistance and fatigue at every step. There are things to blame for this
fatigue in the ascent. Your life weighs; your memories weigh; your
previous actions impede the ascent. The climb is made difficult by the
action of your body, which tends to dominate.</em></p>

<p><em>In the steps of the ascent you will find strange regions of pure colors
and unknown sounds.</em></p>

<p><em>Do not flee purification, which acts like fire and horrifies with its
phantoms.</em></p>

<p><em>Reject startling fears and disheartenment. </em></p>

<p><em>Reject the desire to flee toward low and dark regions.</em></p>

<p><em>Reject the attachment to memories.</em></p>

<p><em>Remain in internal liberty, indifferent toward the dream of the
landscape, with resolution in the ascent.</em></p>

<p><em>The pure light dawns in the summits of the great mountain chains, and
the waters-of-a-thousand-colors flow amid unrecognizable melodies toward
crystalline plateaus and prairies.</em></p>

<p><em>Do not fear the pressure of the light, which pushes against you with
increasing strength the closer you draw to its center. Absorb it as
though it were a liquid or a wind—certainly, in it is life.</em></p>

<p><em>When you find the hidden city in the great mountain chain you must know
the entrance—and you will know it in the moment your life is
transformed. Its enormous walls are written in figures, are written in
colors, are “sensed.” In this city are kept the done and the
yet-to-be-done. But for your inner eye the transparent is opaque. Yes,
the walls are impenetrable for you!</em></p>

<p><em>Take the Force of the hidden city. Return to the world of dense life
with your brow and your hands luminous.”</em></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="xv.theexperienceofpeaceandthepassageoftheforce">XV. The Experience of Peace and the Passage of the Force</h2>

<p>​1. Completely relax your body and quiet your mind. Then, imagine a
transparent and luminous sphere that descends toward you until it comes
to rest in your heart. In that moment you will recognize that the sphere
ceases to appear as an image and transforms into a sensation within your
chest.</p>

<p>​2. Observe how the sensation of the sphere slowly expands from your
heart toward the outside of your body, while your breathing becomes
fuller and deeper. When the sensation reaches the limits of your body
you may stop there and register the experience of internal peace. You
may remain there as long as you feel is appropriate. To conclude the
exercise, calm and renewed, reverse the previous expansion, until
arriving, as in the beginning, at your heart, and finally releasing the
sphere. This work is called the experience of peace.</p>

<p>​3. Should you instead wish to experience the passage of the Force, you
must increase the expansion rather than reversing it, allowing your
emotions and your whole being to follow along. Do not try to pay
attention to your breathing; let it act by itself while you follow the
expansion outward from your body.</p>

<p>​4. Let me repeat: Your attention at such moments must be on the
sensation of the expanding sphere. If you are unable to achieve this, it
is advisable that you stop and try again another time. In any case, even
if you do not produce the passage of the Force you will be able to
experience an interesting sensation of peace.</p>

<p>​5. If, however, you go further, you will begin to experience the
passage of the Force. The sensations from your hands and other areas of
your body will have a different tone than usual. Later you may notice
increasing undulations, and in a short while vivid images and powerful
emotions may arise. Allow the passage to take place&#8230;</p>

<p>​6. Upon receiving the Force, you will, depending upon your habitual
mode of representation, perceive the light or strange sounds. In any
case, what is important is that you experience an amplification of
consciousness, among whose indicators are a greater lucidity and a
disposition to understand what is taking place.</p>

<p>​7. If this singular state has not faded with the passage of time, you
can bring it to an end whenever you wish by imagining or feeling that
the sphere contracts and then leaves you in the same way it arrived in
the beginning.</p>

<p>​8. It is interesting to recognize that many altered states of
consciousness have been and almost always are achieved through the use
of mechanisms similar to those described. These may be disguised,
however, by strange rituals, or at times reinforced by practices
involving extreme fatigue, unbridled motor activity, repetition, and
postures that alter the breathing and distort the general sensation of
the intrabody. In this domain you should also recognize hypnosis,
mediumistic activity, and the effects of drugs—all of which, though they
act through a different pathway, produce similar alterations.
Characteristic of all these cases is an absence of control and a lack of
awareness of what is taking place. Do not trust such manifestations, and
consider them nothing more than “trances” such as those through which
dabblers, the ignorant, and (according to legend) even the “saints” have
passed.</p>

<p>​9. Even if you have followed these recommendations, you may still have
been unable to produce the passage of the Force. This should not become
a source of concern, however. Simply take it as an indicator of a lack
of internal “letting go” which may reflect excessive tensions or
problems with the dynamics of the images—in sum, a fragmentation of
emotional behavior—something that will, moreover, also be present in
your daily life.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="xvi.projectionoftheforce">XVI. Projection of the Force</h2>

<p>​1. If you have experienced the passage of the Force, you will be able
to understand how, based on similar experiences but without
understanding, various peoples went on to develop rites and cults that
later multiplied endlessly. Through experiences like those previously
described there were some who felt that their bodies had “doubled,” and
the experience of the Force gave them the sensation that they could
project this energy outside themselves. </p>

<p>​2. The Force could be “projected” to others and also to objects
particularly “suited” to receive and conserve it. I trust it will not be
difficult for you to understand the function filled by the sacraments of
various religions, as well as the significance of those sacred places
and priests supposedly “charged” with the Force. When certain objects
were surrounded with ceremonies and rites and worshipped with faith in
temples, surely they “gave back” to the believers the energy accumulated
through repeated prayer. Since fundamental internal experience is
essential to understanding in these matters, attempts at understanding
based, as is normally the case, solely on externals—whether cultural,
geographical, historical, or traditional—reveal a limitation in our
knowledge of human realities.</p>

<p>​3. “Projecting,” “charging,” and “replenishing” the Force are subjects
to which we will return later. For now let me say that this same
mechanism continues to operate even in desacralized societies, where
leaders and others imbued with prestige are surrounded by a special aura
in the eyes of those who would like to see them, “touch” them, acquire a
scrap of their clothing, or their possessions.</p>

<p>​4. This occurs because all representations of the “heights” extend from
eye level upward, above the normal line of sight. And the “higher-ups”
are those who “possess” kindness, wisdom, and strength. There, in the
“heights” above, we also find the hierarchies, the powers that be, and
the flags of State. And we, ordinary mortals, must at all costs “ascend”
the social ladder in order to draw closer to power. What a sorry state
we are in, still governed by these mechanisms that coincide with our
internal representation, in which our heads are in the “heights” and our
feet stuck on the ground. What an unhappy state we are in, when we
believe in these things, and believe in them because they have their own
“reality” in our internal representation. What a sorry state we are in,
when our external look is nothing but an unacknowledged projection of
the internal. </p>

<hr />

<h2 id="xvii.lossandrepressionoftheforce">XVII. Loss and Repression of the Force</h2>

<p>​1. The greatest discharges of energy occur through uncontrolled acts,
including unbridled imagination, unchecked curiosity, immoderate small
talk, excessive sexuality, and exaggerated perception—looking,
listening, tasting, and so on in an aimless and excessive manner. But
you should also recognize that many act in these ways because it allows
them to discharge tensions that would otherwise be painful. All things
considered, and given the function served by these discharges, I am sure
you will agree with me that it is not reasonable to repress them but
rather to give order to them.</p>

<p>​2. As for sexuality, you must interpret this correctly: This function
must not be repressed because that will only cause torment and internal
contradiction. Sexuality directs itself toward and concludes in the act
itself, and it is not useful that it continues affecting the
imagination, or is expressed as an obsessive search for a new object of
possession.</p>

<p>​3. The control of sex by a particular social or religious “morality”
has served purposes that had nothing to do with evolution, but the
contrary. </p>

<p>​4. In repressed societies, the Force (the energy of the representation
of the sensation of the intrabody) turned back toward the crepuscular.
In those societies, cases increased of the “possessed,” of “witches,” of
the sacrilegious, and of criminals of all kinds who rejoiced in
suffering and the destruction of life and beauty. In some tribes and
civilizations the criminals were to be found among both the accusers and
the accused. In other cases all that was science and progress was
persecuted because it opposed the irrational, the crepuscular, and the
repressed.</p>

<p>​5. The repression of sex still exists among certain so-called
“primitive peoples,” just as it does in other so-called “advanced
civilizations.” It is evident that although the origins of these two
situations may differ, both are marked by great destructiveness.</p>

<p>​6. If you ask me to explain further, I will tell you that in reality
sex is sacred, and it is the center from which all life and creativity
springs, just as it is from there that all destruction arises when
issues about its functioning are not resolved.</p>

<p>​7. Never believe the lies of the poisoners of life when they refer to
sex as despicable. On the contrary, in it is beauty, and not in vain is
it related to the best feelings of love.</p>

<p>​8. Be careful, then, and consider sex a great wonder, which must be
treated with care, without turning it into a source of contradiction or
disintegration of vital energy.</p>

<h2 id="xviii.actionandreactionoftheforce">XVIII. Action and Reaction of the Force</h2>

<p><em>Earlier I explained to you: “Whenever you find great strength, joy, and
kindness in your heart, or when you feel free and without
contradictions, immediately</em> <em>be internally thankful.” </em></p>

<p>​1. “To be thankful” means to concentrate these positive moods and to
associate them with an image, with a representation. If you have
previously linked positive states in this way, you can, upon finding
yourself in a difficult situation, evoke that representation, and along
with it will arise the positive quality that accompanied it earlier.
Furthermore, since this mental “charge” has been increased through
previous repetitions, it is capable of displacing the negative emotions
that certain situations can impose.</p>

<p>​2. Thus, whatever you ask for will return from within you amplified in
benefit as long as you have accumulated within yourself numerous
positive states. By now it should be unnecessary to repeat that,
believing they would respond to prayers and supplication, this mechanism
has long been used (though in confused ways) to “charge” external
objects or persons, as well as internal entities that have been
“projected.” </p>

<hr />

<h2 id="xix.theinternalstates">XIX. The Internal States</h2>

<p><em>You must now gain sufficient insight into the various internal states
you may find yourself in throughout the course of your life, and
particularly in the course of your evolutionary work. I have no way to
describe these states except by using images, in this case allegorical
ones. These seem to me to have the virtue of “visually” concentrating
complex states and moods. The unusual approach of linking these states
to one another as if they were distinct moments in a single process
introduces a departure from the typically fragmented descriptions to
which we have become accustomed from those who normally deal with such
things. </em></p>

<p>​1. As I mentioned earlier, in the first state, known as Diffuse
Vitality, non-meaning prevails. Here, everything is oriented by physical
needs, though these are often confused with contradictory images and
desires. Here, both motives and all that is done are shrouded in
darkness. In this state you simply vegetate, lost among changing forms.
From this point you can evolve only by following one of two paths: the
way of Death or the way of Mutation.</p>

<p>​2. The path of Death puts you in the presence of a dark and chaotic
landscape. The ancients knew this passage and almost always located it
“underground” or in the abysmal depths. There are those who visited this
kingdom, to later “resurrect” in luminous levels. Understand well that
“below” Death lies Diffuse Vitality. Perhaps the human mind relates
mortal disintegration to subsequent phenomena of transformation; perhaps
it associates this diffuse movement with what takes place before birth.
If your direction is that of ascent, “Death” signifies a break with your
former stage. By taking the path of Death you ascend to another state.</p>

<p>​3. Arriving here you find yourself at the refuge of Regression. Two
ways open from here: One is the road of Repentance; the other, which you
used for the ascent, is the road of Death. If you take the first road it
is because your decision tends to break with your past life. If you go
back along the road of Death you fall again into the depths, with the
sensation of being trapped in a closed circle.</p>

<p>​4. Earlier I told you that there is another path you might take to
escape from the abyss of Vitality; it is the path of Mutation. If you
choose this road it is because you wish to emerge from your unhappy
state, but are unwilling to abandon some of its apparent benefits. It
is, then, a false road known as the “Twisted Hand.” Many are the
monsters who have emerged from the depths through this tortuous
passageway. They have wanted to storm the heavens without abandoning the
hells, and consequently have projected infinite contradiction into the
middle world.</p>

<p>​5. Let us suppose that by ascending from the kingdom of Death and
through your conscious Repentance you have now reached the dwelling of
Tendency. Two narrow supports, Conservation and Frustration, sustain
your dwelling. Conservation is false and unstable; walking along this
path you delude yourself with the idea of permanence, but in reality you
descend rapidly. Should you take the path of Frustration your ascent is
arduous, but this path is the only-one-not-false.</p>

<p>​6. After failure upon failure you can reach the next resting place,
called the “dwelling of deviation.” Take care in choosing between the
two roads now before you. Either you take the road of Resolution, which
carries you to Generation, or you take that of Resentment, which causes
you to descend once more toward Regression. Here you face another
dilemma: Either you choose the labyrinth of conscious life—and you do so
with Resolution—or you return, resentfully, to your previous life. There
are many who, at this point, unable to surpass themselves, cut off their
own possibilities.</p>

<p>​7. But you who have ascended with Resolution now find yourself at the
dwelling known as Generation. Here you face three doors: one called the
Fall, another known as Intent, and the third called Degradation. The
Fall carries you directly to the depths, and only an external accident
can push you toward it; it is unlikely that you would choose that door.
The door of Degradation, however, carries you indirectly to the abyss as
you retrace your steps in a sort of turbulent spiral in which you
continually reconsider all that you have lost and all that you have
sacrificed. This examination of consciousness that leads you to
Degradation is surely a false examination in which you underestimate and
disproportionately evaluate some of what you are comparing. You compare
the effort of the ascent with those “benefits” you have left behind. But
if you examine things more closely, you will see that you have not
abandoned anything for the ascent, but rather for other reasons.
Degradation begins, then, when you misrepresent motives that were not
really related to the ascent. I ask you now: What betrays the mind?
Perhaps it is the false motives of initial enthusiasm? Perhaps it is the
difficulty of the undertaking? Perhaps it is the false memories of
sacrifices that never were, or that were made for other reasons? Saying
this I ask you now: Some time ago your house burned down, and because it
did you chose the ascent. Or do you now think that because of this
ascent, your house burned down? Have you perhaps noticed what has
happened to the other houses around you? There is no doubt that you must
choose the middle door, that of Intent.</p>

<p>​8. Climbing the stairway of Intent you will reach an unstable dome.
From there, take the narrow, winding passageway known as Volubility
until you reach a vast and empty space like a platform, which bears the
name Open-Space-of-the-Energy.</p>

<p>​9. In that open space you may be frightened by the immense, deserted
landscape and the terrifying silence of this night, transfigured by
enormous and immobile stars. There, directly over your head, you will
see set in the firmament the suggestive form of the Black Moon, a
strange, eclipsed moon located exactly opposite the Sun. Here you must
await the dawn patiently and with faith, for nothing bad can happen if
you remain calm.</p>

<p>​10. You may, upon finding yourself in this situation, want to arrange
an immediate way out of there. However, should you try to leave instead
of prudently awaiting the day, you could end up blindly groping your way
anywhere. Remember that all movement here (in the darkness) is false and
is generically called Improvisation. If, forgetting what I tell you now,
you begin to improvise movements, be certain that you will be dragged by
a whirlwind down paths and past dwellings to the darkest depths of
Dissolution.</p>

<p>​11. How difficult it is to comprehend that the internal states are
linked one to another! If you could see what inflexible logic the
consciousness has, you would realize that those who blindly improvise in
this situation inevitably begin to degrade themselves and others. Then,
feelings of Frustration arise in them, and later they fall into
Resentment and finally into Death—forgetting all that they had at one
moment managed to perceive.</p>

<p>​12. If in that open space you manage to reach the day, the radiant Sun
will rise before your eyes, illuminating reality for the first time.
Then you will see that in everything that exists there lives a Plan.</p>

<p>​13. It is unlikely that you will fall from here unless you should
voluntarily choose to descend to obscure regions in order to carry the
light into the darkness.</p>

<p><em>It would not be useful to develop these subjects further, because
without experience they can only mislead by transferring to the field of
the imaginary something that can actually be achieved. May what has been
said here be of service to you. And if you do not find what has been
explained here useful, to what could you object, since for skepticism
nothing has any basis or reason—it is like the image in a mirror, the
sound of an echo, the shadow of a shadow.</em></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="xx.internalreality">XX. Internal Reality</h2>

<p>​1. Take note of my considerations. In them you will not only intuit
allegorical phenomena and landscapes of the external world, but you will
also find true descriptions of the mental world.</p>

<p>​2. Nor should you believe that the “places” through which you pass in
your journey have some sort of independent existence. Such confusion has
often obscured profound teachings, and even today there are some who
believe that the heavens, hells, angels, devils, monsters, enchanted
castles, distant cities, and the rest have visible reality for the
“enlightened.” The same prejudice, but with the opposite interpretation,
has been maintained by skeptics without wisdom who take these things to
be simply “illusions” or “hallucinations” suffered by feverish minds.</p>

<p>​3. I must repeat, then: You should understand that all this deals with
real mental states, even though they are symbolized here by objects that
correspond to the external world.</p>

<p>​4. Remember what I have said, and learn to discover the truth behind
the allegories, which on occasion lead the mind astray, but at other
times translate realities that would be impossible to grasp without such
representation.</p>

<p><em>When they spoke of a city of the gods, which the heroes of many peoples
strove to reach; when they spoke of a paradise where gods and humankind
lived together in transfigured original nature; when they spoke of falls
and floods, great internal truth was told.</em></p>

<p><em>Later, the redeemers brought their messages and came to us in double
nature to reestablish that lost unity for which we yearned. Then, too,
great inner truth was told.</em></p>

<p><em>But when all this was spoken of but set outside the mind it was an
error or a lie.</em></p>

<p><em>However, the fusing of the inner look with the external world forces
this look to travel new paths.</em></p>

<p><em>The heroes of this age fly toward the stars. They fly through regions
previously unknown. They fly out from their world and, without knowing
it, they are impelled toward the internal and luminous center.</em></p>

<h2 id="well-being">Well-Being</h2>

<p><em>This ceremony is carried out at the request of a group of people. When
possible, the participants are seated. The Officiant and Assistant are
standing. </em></p>

<p><strong>Assistant:</strong> We are gathered here to turn our thoughts to those dear
to us. Some of them are facing difficulties in their emotional lives,
some in their relationships with others, some with their health. To them
we direct our thoughts and our best hopes.</p>

<p><strong>Officiant:</strong> We have faith that our call for well-being will reach
them. Let us think of those dear to us. Let us feel the presence of
those dear to us. Let us experience contact with those dear to us. </p>

<p><strong>Assistant:</strong> Let us take some time to meditate on the difficulties
that they are facing… </p>

<p><em>A few minutes are given so that the participants may meditate.</em></p>

<p><strong>Officiant:</strong> Now we would like these people to feel our best hopes for
them. A wave of relief and well-being will reach them…</p>

<p><strong>Assistant:</strong> Let us take a short time to mentally locate the situation
of well-being that we wish for our loved ones&#8230;</p>

<p><em>A few minutes are given for participants to concentrate their minds on
this.</em></p>

<p><strong>Officiant:</strong> We conclude this ceremony by allowing the opportunity,
for those who desire, to feel the presence of those loved ones who,
<em>although they are not here in our time or in our space,</em>are connected
to us in this experience of love, peace, and warm joy…</p>

<p><em>A short time is given for this.</em></p>

<p><strong>Officiant:</strong> This has been good for others, comforting for us, and
inspiring for our lives… Greetings to everyone immersed in this current
of well-being, which has been strengthened by the best wishes of all
those present…</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="protection">Protection</h2>

<p><em>This ceremony may be carried out for an individual or a group. Everyone
is standing. The Officiant and the Assistant are facing the children,
who are surrounded by the other participants.</em></p>

<p><strong>Assistant:</strong> The purpose of this ceremony is to give children
participation in our community. </p>

<p>Since ancient times, children have been the focus of ceremonies such as
namings and baptisms. Through these ceremonies people have recognized a
change of status, in stage of life. </p>

<p>There are today and have long been civil formalities that record the
date and place of birth and other information. However, the spiritual
transcendence that accompanies a ceremony of this kind has nothing to do
with the cold formalities of written documents. Rather, it flows from
the joy of parents, family, and friends when children are publicly
introduced to the community. </p>

<p>This is a ceremony through which the status of children changes as they
become participants in a community that makes a commitment to be
responsible for them should unfortunate events leave them unprotected. </p>

<p>This ceremony requests protection for this child (these children), and
the community welcomes them as new sons and daughters. </p>

<p><em>Following a brief pause, the Officiant addresses those present in a
warm tone.</em></p>

<p><strong>Officiant:</strong> We ask protection for this child (these children).</p>

<p><strong>Assistant:</strong> We welcome them with joy, and commit ourselves to their
protection.</p>

<p><strong>Officiant:</strong> We extend our best wishes&#8230; Peace and joy for all! </p>

<p><em>The Officiant gently lays a hand on the head of each child, kissing
each one on the forehead.</em></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="marriage">Marriage</h2>

<p><em>Everyone is standing. For one or more couples. The Officiant and the
Assistant face the couple(s).</em></p>

<p><strong>Assistant:</strong> Since ancient times marriage has been a ceremony that
marks a change of status for people. </p>

<p>When we end or begin a new stage in life it is often accompanied by a
corresponding ritual. Our personal and social lives are marked by
rituals that, to a greater or lesser degree, we accept as customary. We
greet one another in the morning differently than we do at night; we
shake hands upon meeting people; we celebrate birthdays, graduations,
and new jobs. Our sporting events are accompanied by rituals, and our
religious, political, and civic ceremonies place us in the appropriate
attitude for each occasion. </p>

<p>Marriage is an important change in the status of people, and one for
which all nations require certain legal formalities. That is, the
marital relationship places the spouses in a new situation with respect
to the community and the State. However, when a couple establishes the
bond of marriage, they do so thinking of a new way of life. They do so
with profound feelings, and not merely as a formality. </p>

<p>Consequently, in this ceremony that marks a change of status, the
partners have the intention to establish a new and hopefully lasting
union with one another. They have the desire to receive the best from
each other, and to give the best to each other. And they also intend to
carry this relationship further by bringing children into the world or
adopting them. </p>

<p>Seeing marriage in this way, we may acknowledge the importance of the
legal formalities of this union, but in the spiritual and emotional
sense we say that only the couple endows this ceremony with meaning. In
other words, this ceremony brings two human beings to the situation of
undertaking a new life, and through this ceremony the partners establish
this profound union in accordance with their own feelings. </p>

<p>We do not marry them; they marry one another before our community.</p>

<p><strong>Officiant:</strong> In order for this ceremony to be true and your own, we
ask (<em>addressing one partner</em>): What is this marriage for you? </p>

<p><em>The one addressed by the Officiant responds aloud.</em></p>

<p><strong>Officiant:</strong> (<em>addressing the other partner</em>): What is this marriage
for you?</p>

<p><em>The one addressed by the Officiant responds aloud.</em></p>

<p><strong>Officiant:</strong> Then this marriage will be in accordance with your
expressed desires and your most profound intentions. (<em>Greets the
couple(s) affectionately</em>).</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="assistance">Assistance</h2>

<p><em>This is a ceremony of great affection, requiring the person performing
it to give the best of himself or herself. </em></p>

<p><em>The ceremony may be repeated at the request of the person receiving it
or those caring for him or her. </em></p>

<p><em>The Officiant is alone with the dying person. </em></p>

<p><em>Regardless of whether person who is dying appears lucid or unconscious,
the Officiant comes close to them and speaks slowly in a voice that is
soft and clear.</em></p>

<p><strong>Officiant:</strong> The memories of your life are the judgment of your
actions. You can, in a short time, recall much of what is best in you.
Remember then, but without fear, and purify your memory. Gently
remember, and calm your mind&#8230; </p>

<p><em>The Officiant remains silent for a few minutes, and then resumes
reading in a voice of the same tone and intensity.</em></p>

<p>Reject startling fears and disheartenment&#8230;</p>

<p>Reject the desire to flee toward low and dark regions&#8230;</p>

<p>Reject the attachment to memories&#8230;</p>

<p>Remain in internal liberty, indifferent toward the dream of the
landscape&#8230; </p>

<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>

<p>Resolve now to begin the ascent&#8230;</p>

<p>The pure Light dawns in the summits of the great mountain chains, and
the waters-of-a-thousand-colors flow amid unrecognizable melodies toward
crystalline plateaus and prairies&#8230; </p>

<p>Do not fear the pressure of the Light which pushes against you with
increasing strength the closer you draw to its center. Absorb it as
though it were a liquid or a wind, for certainly, in it is life&#8230;  </p>

<p>When you find the hidden city in the great mountain chain, you must know
the entrance—and you will know it in the moment your life is
transformed. Its enormous walls are written in figures, are written in
colors, are “sensed.” In this city are kept the done and the
yet-to-be-done… </p>

<p><em>The Officiant leaves a brief silence, and then resumes reading in a
voice of the same tone and intensity.</em></p>

<p>Now you are reconciled&#8230; </p>

<p>You are purified…</p>

<p>Prepare to enter the most beautiful City of Light, this city never seen
by the eye, whose song has never been heard by human ears&#8230; </p>

<p>Come, prepare to enter the most beautiful Light&#8230;</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="death">Death</h2>

<p><strong>Officiant:</strong> Life has ceased in this body. We must now make an effort
to separate in our minds the image of this body from the image of the
person we remember&#8230;</p>

<p>This body does not hear us. This body is not the person we remember&#8230;</p>

<p>May those of you who do not feel the presence here of another life,
separate from the body, consider that although death has paralyzed this
body, the actions he/she carried out will continue to act, and their
influence will never end. This chain of actions that was set in motion
in life cannot be stopped by death. How profound it is to meditate on
this truth, even though we may not completely comprehend the
transformation of one action into another! </p>

<p>And may those of you who do feel the presence of a separate life
consider that death has only paralyzed this body, that the mind has once
again triumphantly freed itself, opening its way toward the Light&#8230;</p>

<p>Whatever our views, let us not weep for this body. Rather, let us
meditate on the root of our beliefs, and a gentle and silent joy will
come to us… </p>

<p>Peace in the heart, light in the understanding!</p>

<h2 id="recognition">Recognition</h2>

<p><em>Recognition is a ceremony of inclusion in the Community, inclusion
through common experiences, shared ideals, attitudes, and common
procedures.</em></p>

<p><em>The ceremony is carried out at the request of a group of people and
following a Service. Those who will participate should have the written
text. </em></p>

<p><em>The Officiant and Assistant stand.</em></p>

<p><strong>Assistant:</strong> This ceremony has been requested by people who wish to
actively include themselves in our Community. Through this Ceremony they
express a personal and social commitment to work to improve their own
lives and the lives of those around them. </p>

<p><em>The Assistant invites those who wish to give testimony to stand.</em></p>

<p><strong>Officiant:</strong> The pain and suffering that human beings experience
recedes when good knowledge advances, not knowledge at the service of
selfishness and oppression.</p>

<p>Good knowledge leads to justice.</p>

<p>Good knowledge leads to reconciliation.</p>

<p>Good knowledge also leads us to decipher the sacred in the depths of our
consciousness.</p>

<p><strong>Assistant</strong> (<em>and those giving testimony read</em>):</p>

<p>We consider the human being to be the highest value—above money, the
State, religion, the models, and social systems. </p>

<p>We promote liberty of thought.</p>

<p>We promote equal rights and equal opportunities for all human beings.</p>

<p>We recognize and applaud diversity in customs and cultures. </p>

<p>We oppose all discrimination.</p>

<p>We consecrate just resistance against all forms of violence: physical,
economic, racial, religious, sexual, psychological, and moral. </p>

<p><strong>Officiant:</strong> Just as no one has the right to discriminate against
others for their religion or their non-religiousness, we affirm our
right to proclaim our spirituality and our belief in immortality and the
sacred. </p>

<p>Our spirituality is not the spirituality of superstition, it is not the
spirituality of intolerance, it is not the spirituality of dogma, it is
not the spirituality of religious violence. It is the spirituality that
has awakened from its deep sleep to nurture the best aspirations of the
human being.</p>

<p><strong>Assistant</strong> (<em>and those giving testimony read</em>):</p>

<p>We want to give coherence to our lives, to make coincide what we think,
what we feel, and what we do. </p>

<p>We want to surpass bad conscience by acknowledging our failures.</p>

<p>We aspire to persuade and to reconcile. </p>

<p>We make a commitment to increasingly fulfill the rule that reminds us to
“treat others as we want to be treated.” </p>

<p><strong>Officiant:</strong> Let us begin a new life.</p>

<p>Let us search within ourselves for the signs of the sacred, and let us
carry our message to others. </p>

<p><strong>Assistant</strong> (<em>and those giving testimony read</em>):</p>

<p>Today we begin to renew our lives. Let us begin by seeking mental peace
and the Force that gives us joy and conviction. Afterwards, let us go to
those closest to us and share with them everything great and good that
has happened to us. </p>

<p><strong>Officiant:</strong> Peace, Force, and Joy for everyone. </p>

<p><strong>Assistant</strong> (<em>and all those present</em>):</p>

<p>For you also, Peace, Force, and Joy.</p>

<h1 id="thepath">The Path</h1>

<p>If you believe that your life will end with death, nothing that you
think, feel, or do has any meaning. Everything will end with incoherence
and disintegration. </p>

<p>If you believe that your life does not end with death, you must bring
into agreement what you think with what you feel and what you do. All
must advance toward coherence, toward unity. </p>

<p>If you are indifferent to the pain and suffering of others, none of the
help that you ask for will find justification. </p>

<p>If you are not indifferent to the pain and suffering of others, in order
to help them you must bring your thoughts, feelings, and actions into
agreement.</p>

<p>Learn to treat others in the way that you want to be treated. </p>

<p>Learn to surpass pain and suffering in yourself, in those close to you,
and in human society. </p>

<p>Learn to resist the violence that is within you and outside of you. </p>

<p>Learn to recognize the signs of the sacred within you and around you. </p>

<p>Do not let your life pass by without asking yourself, “Who am I?” </p>

<p>Do not let your life pass by without asking yourself, “Where am I
going?” </p>

<p>Do not let a day pass by without giving an answer to yourself about who
you are.</p>

<p>Do not let a day pass by without giving an answer to yourself about
where you are going. </p>

<p>Do not let a great joy pass without giving thanks internally. </p>

<p>Do not let a great sadness pass without calling into your interior for
the joy that you have saved there.</p>

<p>Do not imagine that you are alone in your village, in your city, on the
Earth, or among the infinite worlds. </p>

<p>Do not imagine that you are enchained to this time and this space. </p>

<p>Do not imagine that in your death loneliness will become eternal. </p>
